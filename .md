# HealthyLife Hospital Network Infrastructure (Capstone Project)

This repository documents the **NSA630 Capstone Project**: a fully designed, configured, and tested hospital IT infrastructure.
The project simulates a real-world healthcare environment with enterprise-grade networking, security, and services.

## Project Highlights
- **Enterprise Network Design**: 4 Cisco routers, 4 switches, firewall, and multiple servers.
- **Segmentation**: 7 VLANs for hospital departments (Outpatient, Inpatient, Research, Admin, Guest, IT).
- **Core Services**: Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Backup Server, RADIUS Authentication.
- **High Availability**: HSRP for gateway redundancy, EtherChannel for link redundancy.
- **Security**: ACLs, SSH access, firewall rules, endpoint hardening.
- **Cloud Integration**: Microsoft 365 email with custom domain.
- **Web Development**: Hospital website (HTML, CSS, JS) + Flask backend for appointment booking.
